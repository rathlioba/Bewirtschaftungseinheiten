# Bewirtschaftungseinheiten

# This code is a result of my master thesis "Waldplanung im stufigen Wald - Individuell anpassbare Bewirtschaftungseinheiten basierend auf einem Set an objektiven Kriterien". It is used to group an area of forest into management units based on several criteria. These criteria can be chosen at the beginning of the code to be included or not. 
# The grouping of forest into management units is based on a network analysis originally developed by Leo Bont (WSL). It uses the method of finding the shortest path from the forest to a forest road or the forest edge. 
# As this is my first coding, the programming can be optimized and will be further developed.
